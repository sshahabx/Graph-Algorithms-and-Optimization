Run the driver file, the code will: 
*  normalize the input data and will store it in the new file
* compute shortest path from a source to all the other nodes using Dijkstra and Bellman ford algorithms.
* Will generate a minimum spanning tree using prim’s algorithm
* Generate a dot file that can be used to visualize the graph


Graph implementation is in the header file.
The sorting.cpp will sort (heapsort,merge sort, quick sort) the graph data based on the epoch time values in the 4th column and will also transform it in human readable format.
